It is enabling classifiers which detect cardiac disease or diabetes during eye tests. Others point to agricultural uses such as robotic pollination of plants and weed eradication using lasers.</p><p>A former council member of the Open Source Society, employer and friend of mine, Igor Portugal, is writing a book about a positive AI future called \"The Planet Fortht: Enslaving Freedom\", which according to an online description presents</p><blockquote>Utopian world where AI and other advanced technologies safeguard individuals, uphold justice, and deter crime. Nobody is above the law, and justice is administered to anyone who causes harm to another human being.</blockquote><p>So perhaps let me begin by steel manning this argument. It is a proposition that the AI will not destroy us, but rather will serve us and be obedient. Consequently society will benefit greatly on many levels.</p><p>In this vision the outcome is a society where the needs and desires of people are met. It is a future of abundance, where people will no longer be constrained by the need to work, where we will have access to entertainment, amazing food, health care, and education.</p><p>It would be a golden age, where people would have no need to work. Virtual reality could deliver any sensory experience you desire in complete safety.</p><p>Enabling this future would be obedient intelligent machines doing all the work for us. From growing food, to providing health care, running power plants, designing and manufacturing goods, even educating children. All would be done by artificial intelligence and robots that are both more intelligent than humans while also being perfectly obedient.</p><p>Perhaps this story sounds familiar. Agent Smith describes it in The Matrix.</p><blockquote>Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world. None suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost.</blockquote><p><br></p>"
